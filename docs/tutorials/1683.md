[1683. Invalid Tweets](https://leetcode.com/problems/invalid-tweets/)

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Return the result table in any order.


## Solution

The provided solution utilizes a simple `SELECT` statement combined with a length checking function:

```sql
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation
- `SELECT tweet_id`:
  - Specifies that we want to retrieve the `tweet_id` column.
- `FROM Tweets`:
  - The query fetches data from the table named `Tweets`.
- `WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15`:
  - The `LENGTH()` function calculates the number of characters in the `content` field.
- The` WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those rows where the `content` has more than 15 characters.
