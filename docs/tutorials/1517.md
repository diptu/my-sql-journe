[1517. Find Users With Valid E-Mails](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-users-with-valid-e-mails/)

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to find the users who have valid emails.

A valid e-mail has a prefix name and a domain where:

The prefix name is a string that may contain letters (upper or lower case), digits, underscore '_', period '.', and/or dash '-'. The prefix name must start with a letter.
The domain is '@leetcode.com'.
Return the result table in any order.


## Solution

This query retrieves user information (user_id, name, mail) from the Users table, but only for users with an email address that matches the pattern of being a valid LeetCode email (@leetcode.com).

It is a great example of how regular expressions can be used in SQL to filter data with complex patterns!



```sql title="query:01"
SELECT user_id, name, mail
FROM Users
WHERE mail REGEXP '^[a-zA-Z]{1}[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*@leetcode[.]com$'
```

### ðŸ“ˆ Breakdown of the Query
| Part of Regex       | Explanation                                                                 |
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `^`                 | Anchors the start of the string. Ensures the email starts from the first character. |
| `[a-zA-Z]{1}`       | Matches 1 alphabet character (either lowercase or uppercase). This is the first character of the email before the `@` symbol. |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*`   | Matches any sequence (including none) of the following characters: lowercase or uppercase letters (`a-zA-Z`), digits (`0-9`), and special characters like underscore (`_`), period (`.`), or hyphen (`-`). |
| `[.]` | `[.]` : This matches the literal dot (.) character|

```sql title="query:02 âœ…"
SELECT *
FROM Users
WHERE 
    REGEXP_LIKE(mail, '^[A-Za-z]+[A-Za-z0-9\_\.\-]*@leetcode\\.com$');
```

### Key Differences:
- `REGEXP_LIKE` vs `REGEXP`:

- `REGEXP_LIKE` is a more performance-optimized function for matching patterns, especially for cases like validating emails, and is often faster than the more generic `REGEXP` function.

- The improved internal optimizations and potential caching mechanisms in `REGEXP_LIKE` allow it to perform better, especially when dealing with complex patterns or repeated queries.

- The pattern itself is similar in both queries, but `REGEXP_LIKE` is designed to handle matching more efficiently in most modern MySQL setups (starting from version 8.0).
