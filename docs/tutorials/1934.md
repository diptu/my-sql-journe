[1934. Confirmation Rate](https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/)

## Problem Statement

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.


## Solution

# ðŸ“Š Explanation of the SQL Query

This SQL query calculates the **confirmation rate** for each user by determining the percentage of "confirmed" actions out of all possible actions for each user. The query uses the `RIGHT JOIN` to ensure all users from the `Signups` table are included, even if there is no corresponding record in the `Confirmations` table.


```sql title="query01"
SELECT user_id, 
ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Confirmations
RIGHT JOIN Signups USING (user_id)  
GROUP BY user_id;
```

### ðŸ“ˆ Breakdown of the Query

# ðŸ”ŽSQL Query Breakdown

### 1. `SELECT user_id,`
- **Purpose**: Selects the `user_id` column from the result set.
- **Explanation**: This part of the query retrieves the unique identifier for each user in the final result.

### 2. `ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS confirmation_rate`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the **confirmation rate** for each user and rounds the result to 2 decimal places.
- **Explanation**:
  - **`CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END`**:
    - This conditional expression checks if the `action` is `'confirmed'`.
    - If the `action` is `'confirmed'`, it returns `1`. Otherwise, it returns `0`.
  - **`AVG()`**: The `AVG()` function calculates the **average** of the `1`s and `0`s, effectively computing the confirmation rate.
    - The confirmation rate is the percentage of times the action was 'confirmed' compared to all actions for each user.
  - **`ROUND(..., 2)`**: This rounds the calculated average (confirmation rate) to **2 decimal places**, making the result more readable.
  - **`AS confirmation_rate`**: Aliases the resulting column as `confirmation_rate`, which will be used in the output.

### 3. `FROM Confirmations`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the source table for the data.
- **Explanation**: The query retrieves data from the `Confirmations` table, which stores records of user actions, such as whether an action was confirmed.

### 4. `RIGHT JOIN Signups USING (user_id)`
- **Purpose**: Performs a **RIGHT JOIN** between the `Confirmations` table and the `Signups` table using the `user_id` column.
- **Explanation**:
  - **RIGHT JOIN** ensures that all rows from the `Signups` table are included in the result, even if there is no corresponding record in the `Confirmations` table.
  - **`USING (user_id)`**: This specifies that the join should be based on the `user_id` column, which exists in both tables.

### 5. `GROUP BY user_id`
- **Purpose**: Groups the results by `user_id`.
- **Explanation**: The `GROUP BY` clause ensures that the aggregation (i.e., calculating the average confirmation rate) is done for each individual user, rather than for the entire dataset.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Summary:
- The query calculates the **confirmation rate** for each user.
- It uses a **RIGHT JOIN** to include all users from the `Signups` table, even if they don't have a corresponding entry in the `Confirmations` table.
- The confirmation rate is calculated by counting the number

```sql title="query02"
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    ROUND(AVG(IF(c.action = 'confirmed', 1, 0)), 2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups AS s
LEFT OUTER JOIN Confirmations AS c
ON s.user_id = c.user_id
GROUP BY s.user_id;
```

### ðŸš€ Why the Query02 is Faster:
- `LEFT JOIN` is more efficient than RIGHT JOIN in this scenario.

- Using the `IF()` function for conditional logic is more efficient than CASE WHEN.

- The query reduces redundant data and processing by efficiently joining and aggregating the data.

- Indexing optimization with `LEFT JOIN` and direct aggregation with AVG() improve the overall performance of the query.

- In conclusion, the use of a `LEFT JOIN`, `IF()` function, and efficient aggregation makes this query faster compared to the previous one by minimizing data processing and enhancing the overall query optimization.
