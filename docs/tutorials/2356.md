[2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-unique-subjects-taught-by-each-teacher/)

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is shown in the following example.


## Solution

The provided solution utilizes a simple `SELECT` with `GROUP BY` statement combined with a `DISTINCT` & `COUNT()` function:


```sql title="query:01 âœ…"
SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(subject_id) ) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY teacher_id
```
```sql title="query:02"
select teacher_id, count(distinct(subject_id)) as cnt
from Teacher
group by 1;
```

### ðŸ§  Explanation

| Part | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `SELECT teacher_id,` | Selects the `teacher_id` from the `Teacher` table. |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT(subject_id)) AS cnt` | Counts the number of unique subjects taught by each teacher and names it `cnt`. |
| `FROM Teacher` | Specifies the source table: `Teacher`. |
| `GROUP BY teacher_id` | Groups the rows by teacher so that the count is calculated per teacher instead of globally. |

#### ðŸ“ˆ Step-by-Step Breakdown
- âœ… Group all rows by teacher_id.

- âœ… For each group, count the distinct subject_id values.

- âœ… Output:

- `teacher_id`, Number of unique subjects taught (cnt).


### ðŸ›  Why Query 1 was faster?
1. Simpler Parsing
In Query 1, MySQL immediately knows:

- "Group by teacher_id."

- In Query 2, MySQL must first resolve:

- "What is column 1?" â†’ Then realize it's teacher_id â†’ Then group by it.

- That extra resolution step can add a tiny bit of overhead.


### âš¡ Quick Tip:
ðŸ‘‰ Best Practice:
- Always use explicit column names in `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, etc.
- Itâ€™s faster, more readable, and future-proof.

- When writing SQL queries, using the actual column name in the GROUP BY clause is often faster and more efficient than using a column position (number).

#### âœ… Explanation:

  - `GROUP BY 1` groups by the first column listed in the SELECT statement (`teacher_id`).

  - MySQL must first resolve what column 1 refers to.

  - Adds a tiny extra parsing step.

  - MySQL may not immediately recognize indexes or optimize as aggressively.Slightly slower in some cases.
