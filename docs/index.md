## Embarking on the SQL Learning Path

This repository documents my personal journey to master Structured Query Language (SQL) through hands-on practice. The primary source of exercises and challenges comes from LeetCode's SQL problem set. The goal is not just to solve problems, but to deeply understand the underlying concepts and develop proficiency in writing efficient and effective SQL queries.

Each solved LeetCode problem will be committed to this repository with:

* **Clear and well-commented SQL code:** Explaining the logic and reasoning behind the solution.
* **Potentially multiple solutions:** Exploring different approaches and their trade-offs.
* **Reflections and insights:** Sharing what I learned from the problem and any challenges encountered.

## What You'll Find Here

As this journey progresses, you'll find solutions covering a wide range of SQL topics, including:

* **Basic Queries:** `CREATE`,`INSERT`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`
* **Filtering and Sorting:** Using operators like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`
* **Aggregate Functions:** `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
* **Joins:** `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`
* **Subqueries:** Using queries within other queries
* **Set Operations:** `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
* **Window Functions:** Performing calculations across a set of table rows
* **Schema Design Considerations:** Thoughts on table structures and relationships (where applicable in problem context)
* **Optimization Techniques:** Exploring ways to write more performant SQL (when relevant to the problem)
* **Potentially explorations of different SQL dialects:** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite - depending on LeetCode problem context)
* **Progress Tracking:** Observing the evolution of my SQL skills over time.

## Who Might Find This Useful?

* **Fellow SQL Learners:** You can follow my progress, compare your solutions, and potentially learn from my insights and mistakes.
* **Aspiring Data Analysts and Engineers:** Get a practical view of how SQL is used to solve real-world-like problems.
* **Developers Looking to Brush Up on SQL:** See practical examples of various SQL concepts in action.
* **Anyone Curious About the Process of Learning SQL:** Witness the journey of building SQL proficiency through consistent practice.

## How to Navigate This Repository

* Each LeetCode problem will likely have its own clearly named file.
* The filenames will ideally correspond to the LeetCode problem number and title for easy reference.
* Comments within the SQL files will provide explanations and context.
